        The includes() method checks a certain value is present in array or not. If the specific value is found, it returns true else returns false.

                                                                Array.prototype.indexOf()
                                                              
 1. Fathima Saja S:
              The indexOf() method gives the first index of the search element present in the array. If the element is not present in the array, it returns -1.
When the element is present in multiple times in an array, it can be searched from a particular index by indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex).
